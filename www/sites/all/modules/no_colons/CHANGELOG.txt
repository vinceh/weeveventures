No Colons 6.x-1.1
================================================================================
- by minorscience: Added additional selectors to no_colons.js so that module 
also works for inline CCK fields (previously only worked when label display was 
set to "Above").

- Reformatted and edited README.txt

- Removed old CVS tags; git doesn't need those!
