Media Mover - Embedded Media Field Integration
----------------------------------------------

This module will add Embedded Media Field support to Media Mover. It will add
a Complete configuration action that will take a URL passed by a supported
provider module and store it in an Embedded Media Field instance.

For this module to work properly, you'll need to also use a provider that
supports an uploading API, such as Brightcove or YouTube. See the Media:
Brightcove module at http://drupal.org/project/media_brightcove or the Media:
YouTube module at http://drupal.org/project/media_youtube as examples.
