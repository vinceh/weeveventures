Video Upload module installation instructions
---------------------------------------------

YouTube Provider
----------------

1) Download the Zend GData client library:

   http://framework.zend.com/download/gdata/

2) a) Extract the tar archive, and move the subdirectory library/Zend into
      this directory. For example:

        mv ~/downloads/ZendGdata-1.x.x/library/Zend/ /path/to/drupal/modules/video_upload/providers/youtube

      replacing 1.x.x with the actual version. The current build has been tested with 1.7.2.

   -or-

   b) Install the libary somewhere in the existing PHP include_path of
      the server.

3) Enable the Video Upload module via admin/build/modules

4) Browse to admin/settings/video_upload and complete the necessary
   fields.

5) Note, if using the direct upload method (video from user to server,
   from server to provider), the videos are sent to the provider
   during cron processing. As such, it may be desirable to have a
   more frequent cron job so users don't wait too long.

   Additionally, the default PHP settings for upload_max_filesize and
   post_max_size (8MB) are far too low for handling video, and should
   be bumped up to a more appropriate limit.

6) Add a video upload field to a content type and start uploading
   video.

7) Make sure that your Drupal site has cron configured
   (http://drupal.org/cron), since this is how files are transmitted
   to the video provider.

8) OPTIONAL: To run tests on this module, add account information to
   your settings.php file in the form:

     $GLOBALS['video_upload_test_account'] = array(
       'video_upload_youtube_developer_key' => {KEY},
       'video_upload_youtube_username' => {USERNAME},
       'video_upload_youtube_password' => {PASSWORD},
     );
