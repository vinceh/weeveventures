List of to-do items for the video_upload module, in no particular order.
@todo tags can also be found distributed througout the code.

* Completely abstract out the Zend Gdata library so that this module
  could use the Drupal Youtube API module. The reason for this is that
  the Zend library requires modification of the PHP include_path
  variable, which can be hard for shared-hosting sites.

* Abstract out the YouTube specificity, so that this logic could apply
  to other providers. This work has been started by moving most
  YouTube logic into the providers directory. There is still a lot
  left to do though.

* Make a 2 step form? Not sure if this is better. The advantages:
   - Collect all relevant info prior to submitting data to youtube
  The disadvantages:
   - it's a 2-step form, not sure how that would work with all CCK scenarios

* Allow for multiple YouTube accounts per site (or per field instance,
  etc).  The YouTube API limits uploads on accounts with more than
  1000 videos:

* Handle the selection of which thumbnail to use: YouTube provides 3
  thumbnails, which the user should be able to select from.

* The description that is sent/synchronized on YouTube should be able
  to pull from fields other than node->body. This should be
  configurable.

* When configuring a field, any known vocabularies should be presented
  as options for YouTube keywords

* Extend token support
