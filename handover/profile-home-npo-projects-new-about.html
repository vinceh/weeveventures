				<div class='npo-about-content weevesubtitle'>
					World Vision International as an umbrella organization was founded in 1977 by Walter Stanley Mooneyham the president of World Vision.[5][6] It was the result of a restructuring process that began already in the early 1970s within World Vision Inc. which was already founded in 1950 by Bob Pierce and did business as "World Vision International" since 1966.[7] World Vision International took over most international functions which were previously fulfilled by World Vision Inc. and was headquartered in Monrovia, California, in the same building as World Vision Inc. W. Mooneyham became also president of World Vision International until 1982 when he resigned after criticism within the International Board, where the accusations ranged from a dictatorial leadership style to an ethnocentric American communication style.[8]</br></br>
Already in 1967 the Mission Advanced Research and Communication Center (MARC) was founded by Ed Dayton as a Division of World Vision International. It became the organizational backbone of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, collected and published data about "unreached people" and also published the "Mission Handbook: North American Protestant Ministries Overseas".[9]
