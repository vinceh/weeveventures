			<div class='project-content-title'>About</div>
			<div class='project-content-content'>High levels of violence, homelessness, addictions and poverty characterize the Downtown Eastside community, and women and children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, injustice and injury. Founded in 1978, DEWC is one of the few safe spaces within the Downtown Eastside exclusively for women and their children. </br></br>
			
			The Downtown Eastside Women's Centre is building a new shelter that aims to provide women and their children hot meals, free clothing, secure mailing address, phone and computer access, functioning and secure toilets and shower.   </br></br>

			Our new shelter project requires $6000 to cover the following costs:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Equipments</li>
				<li>Tables and Chairs</li>
				<li>Building functional showers and toilets</li>
				<li>Staffing</li>
				<li>Food</li>
				<li>Utility</li>
			</ul>
	
			We also help reduce the effect of economic disadvantage by providing:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Toiletries</li>
				<li>Haircuts</li>
				<li>Sewing machines</li>
				<li>Feminine hygiene products</li>
				<li>Computer access</li>
				<li>Harm reduction supplies</li>
				<li>First aid</li>
			</ul>
			
			The New Shelter will assist women with their immediate and crisis needs so they can develop stability and access the resources they need to improve health, family, employment and housing situations. We promote positive change by offering individual long-term support, education, advocacy, peer mentorship and exposure to alternatives. </br></br>

			Our community also works towards increasing awareness of systemic injustice and inequalities that contribute to women’s vulnerability. One of our goals is to bring awareness of poverty and violence issues to the general public and to the government. </br></br>

			Thank you so much for your contribution! Your contribution will help  300 women and children in the Downtown Eastside community. </div>
