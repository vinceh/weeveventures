					Your money in ACTION!
					<div class='project-update-date'>23 hours ago</div>
				</div>

				<div class='project-update-content'>Hello world changers! Here are some of the photos of people who you’ve helped! Look at the smiles on their faces. You have restored hope, and give them a meaning of life. You’ve made a difference. You changed someone’s life. And on behalf of the community, we would like to thank you for your support! <br/><br/>

				<img class='update-image' src='shelterupdate.jpg'></img> </br></br>
				
				The shelter now accommodates 329 women, children, and seniors, and they have been nothing but grateful. Our education program helped 48 kids to get into their local schools, where they can lead a normal childhood. Our food program provided over 20,000 hot meals over the last month for these people. Fifteen families have achieved financial stability, and are now on their way to start a new life. This is all made possible because of you. Thank you! <br/><br/>

				Sincerely, <br/><br/>

				Joanna F. Logan <br/><br/>

				Director

					Shelter project funded, along with education and first aid programs! 
					<div class='project-update-date'>23 hours ago</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class='project-update-content'>Wow! We did it! YOU did it! We are so impressed by the amount of support we’ve been receiving over the last month. The project is now officially funded! Thank you for your continuous support! <br/><br/>

				We have negotiated with Telus to provide free internet access to our facility. Women and children can now participate in our education program that requires the Internet. Education is the first step to help these families to understand their condition, and how they can improve on it. We are very excited to offer 16 computers for people to learn, and walk towards a better life! <br/><br/>


				In addition, we also funded our first aid program. The program provides standard first aid care to women and their children so in cases of emergencies, we have the resource to help these people. <br/><br/>

				Your contribution keeps our mission alive, and on behalf of our entire team, I would like to sincerely thank you for making our community a better place. <br/><br/>

				Kind Regards, <br/><br/>

				Joanna F. Logan <br/><br/>

					Thank you!
					<div class='project-update-date'>2 hours ago</div>
				</div>

				<div class='project-update-content'>We are stoked to see so much support from our community! The response has been phenomenal so far, and our team is confident that this project will be on its way to provide support to more than 300 women and their children in the Downtown Eastside community. <br/><br/>

				Winter is usually dreadful for most homeless families, but they will receive warmth from your contribution. We are happy to announce that PerfectBites is going to provide catering for those who are in need. <br/><br/>
				

				Again, thank you so much for your support. Please take a moment to spread this project via the sharing buttons on the sidebar. Winter would not be cold as long as we keep our hearts warm!<br/><br/>

				Take Care,<br/><br/>

				Joanna F. Logan<br/><br/>
